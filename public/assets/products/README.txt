Place your shared product images in this folder.

Then add each file to library.json using:
{
  "label": "Readable name",
  "path": "/assets/products/your-file-name.jpg"
}

In Admin > Product Editor you can pick these images from the dropdown.
You can also upload images directly from your computer; those are stored in browser localStorage as data URLs.
